This is my art portfolio, as well as my training website to keep myself updated on front-end development and to experiment some functionalities. This website may change hosting service with time, depending on how it will evolve.
Code is either written by me or something I found on Internet and adapted to my needs. So, there shouldn't be copyright issue with it.
Art copyright owned by me, Josyanne Cloutier, alias jcloutierart.
